# Installing and Activating License

GridBeat is an open source project. We encourage our community to develop their own pluggable modules.

Core framework, dashboard and a few plugin modules such as modbus-tcp, mqtt and eKuiper are open source under Apache-2.0 license. GridBeat may run with these open source modules without an license. But all other commercial plugin modules require an official EMQ license to run without limitation.
