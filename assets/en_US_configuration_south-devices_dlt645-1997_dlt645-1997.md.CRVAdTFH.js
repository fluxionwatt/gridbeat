It is also known as the &quot;Communication Protocol of Electronic Energy Meters.&quot; This standard specifies the communication protocol and data format for the exchange of information between electronic energy meters and data collection systems.</p><p>DL/T645-1997 defines the structure of data frames, the content of data fields, and the communication methods to be used for transmitting energy consumption and other related information. It covers various aspects such as meter reading, load control, event recording, and parameter setting.</p><p>The standard provides a common framework for communication between energy meters and utility companies or other entities involved in energy monitoring and management. It enables accurate and efficient data collection, billing, and analysis of energy usage.</p><p>It&#39;s worth noting that the DL/T645-1997 standard is relatively old, as it was published in 1997. There might be more recent versions or successor standards that have been introduced since then to keep up with advancements in technology and address emerging requirements.</p><p>The DL/T645-1997 plugin supports serial port connections and transparent TCP connections.</p><h2 id="add-device" tabindex="-1">Add Device <a class="header-anchor" href="#add-device" aria-label="Permalink to “Add Device”">​</a></h2><p>Go to <strong>Configuration -&gt; South Devices</strong>, then click <strong>Add Device</strong> to add the driver.
