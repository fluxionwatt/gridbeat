It is part of the IEC 60870-5 series, which includes various protocols commonly used in the field of power system automation.</p><p>Specifically, IEC 60870-5-101 is suitable for point-to-point communication via a serial interface, usually using the EIA-232 or EIA-485 standard. It allows the master station (such as the control center) to exchange real-time data and commands with remote terminal units (RTUs) located in substations. These RTUs are responsible for monitoring and controlling the equipment and processes in the substation.</p><h2 id="add-device" tabindex="-1">Add Device <a class="header-anchor" href="#add-device" aria-label="Permalink to “Add Device”">​</a></h2><p>In <strong>Configuration -&gt; Southbound Devices</strong>, click <strong>Add Device</strong> to create a device node, enter the plugin name, and select <strong>IEC60870-5-101</strong> as the plugin type to enable the plugin.</p><h2 id="device-configuration" tabindex="-1">Device Configuration <a class="header-anchor" href="#device-configuration" aria-label="Permalink to “Device Configuration”">​</a></h2><p>On the <strong>Southbound Devices</strong> page, click the device card to enter the device configuration page and configure the device parameters.</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Serial Device</strong></td><td>The path of the serial device in serial mode, such as /dev/ttyS0 in Linux system.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Stop Bits</strong></td><td>Serial connection parameters in serial mode.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Parity Bits</strong></td><td>Serial connection parameters in serial mode.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Baud Rate</strong></td><td>Serial connection parameters in serial mode.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Data Bits</strong></td><td>Serial connection parameters in serial mode.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Device IP Address</strong></td><td>IPv4 address of the device</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Device Port</strong></td><td>Device port number, default is 2404</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Common Address</strong></td><td>Common address, unique identifier for data objects</td></tr><tr><td><strong>General Call Interval</strong></td><td>Interval for sending general call commands</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="set-groups-and-points" tabindex="-1">Set Groups and Points <a class="header-anchor" href="#set-groups-and-points" aria-label="Permalink to “Set Groups and Points”">​</a></h2><p>After adding and configuring the plugin, you need to establish communication between the device and GridBeat by adding groups and points to the southbound driver.</p><p>After completing the device configuration, click the device card/device column to enter the <strong>Group List</strong> page.
