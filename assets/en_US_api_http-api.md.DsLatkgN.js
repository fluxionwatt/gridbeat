The key features of these APIs are:</p><p><a href="./rw.html">Acquiring Data:</a> The HTTP APIs enable the platform to monitor the acquired data from devices connected to the IIoT platform. This allows for real-time monitoring of sensor readings, operational parameters, and device status.</p><p><a href="./rw.html">Control Commands:</a> The APIs also facilitate sending control commands to the GridBeat devices, enabling the platform to remotely control and manage the devices. This allows for seamless management of device functionalities.</p><p><a href="./configuration.html">Remote Setup and Configuration:</a> The platform can remotely set up and configure device connections using the HTTP APIs. This ensures convenient and efficient management of the devices without the need for physical access. <a href="./plugin-setting.html">Plugin Settings</a> is also available.</p><p><a href="./jwt.html">JWT Authentication:</a> The APIs employ JWT authentication, ensuring secure communication and authentication between the IIoT platform or monitoring application and the GridBeat devices. This enhances the overall security of the system.</p><p><a href="./metrics.html">Prometheus-Compatible Metrics:</a> The API provides Prometheus-compatible metrics data. This allows for easy integration with Prometheus monitoring tools, facilitating efficient monitoring and analysis of device metrics.</p><p><a href="./data-type.html">Data Type Descriptions:</a> To ensure clarity and consistency in data representation and interpretation, the API describes the data types used. This promotes seamless data integration and analysis within the IIoT platform or monitoring application.</p><p><a href="./error-code.html">Error Code Descriptions:</a> The API includes comprehensive error code descriptions, providing information about the nature and cause of any encountered errors. This assists in effective troubleshooting and issue resolution.</p>',9)])])}const f=t(n,[["render",r]]);export{m as __pageData,f as default};
