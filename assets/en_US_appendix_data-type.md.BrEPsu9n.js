For example, integers typically require 4 bytes of memory, while floating-point numbers may require 8 bytes or more. Therefore, using the correct data type can ensure memory usage efficiency and program performance.</li><li>Data processing: Different data types can support different operations and calculations. For example, integers can be used in arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, while strings can be used in operations such as concatenation and splitting. Using the correct data type can ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of data processing.</li><li>Input/output: Different data types require different input/output methods. For example, integers can be read/written using standard input/output, while images need to be read/written using specific image formats. Using the correct data type can ensure that programs can read and write data correctly.</li><li>Code logic: Different data types correspond to different meanings and uses, so choosing the correct data type is important in reflecting the code logic and intent.For example, boolean variables are typically used in flow control and logical judgments, while integers and floating-point numbers are typically used in mathematical calculations.</li></ul><p>In summary, selecting and using the correct data type is a crucial step in programming, as it directly affects program correctness, performance, and maintainability.

For example, the data essence of the number 1065353216 under the int data type is &quot;00 00 80 3F,&quot; while the data essence of the number 1 under the float data type is also &quot;00 00 80 3F.&quot; However, when faced with the data &quot;00 00 80 3F,&quot; it is impossible to know what it represents. One might assume that 1065353216 is too large and must be a float value of 1, but this is a subjective judgment made by humans, and the program itself is unaware. Therefore, when interpreting data, it is important to use the same data type as the original data to avoid producing garbled output. In other words, the data should be parsed using the same data type it was originally encoded as.</p></div><h2 id="about-data-arrangement" tabindex="-1">About data arrangement <a class="header-anchor" href="#about-data-arrangement" aria-label="Permalink to “About data arrangement”">​</a></h2><p>There is an example in the above data table.
