It is an improvement over RS-232 in terms of speed, distance, and noise immunity.</p><p>RS-485 uses differential signaling, meaning it transmits data using two wires, one carrying the positive signal and the other carrying the negative signal. This allows for noise cancellation and makes it less susceptible to interference.</p><p>RS-485 can support up to 32 devices on a single bus, with distances of up to 1,200 meters at a speed of 100 kbps. At lower speeds, the distance can be increased up to 4,000 meters.</p><p>RS-485 is commonly used in industrial automation, process control, and building automation systems. It is also used in applications where multiple devices need to communicate over long distances, such as security systems and remote monitoring systems.</p><p>The RS-485 interface typically uses two signal wires, namely A and B, for data transmission. Data is encoded and decoded by the voltage difference between the A and B wires to achieve data transmission and reception. It also supports half-duplex communication mode, which means that data can only be sent or received at the same time.</p><h3 id="converter" tabindex="-1">Converter <a class="header-anchor" href="#converter" aria-label="Permalink to “Converter”">​</a></h3><p>A USB to RS485 converter is a device that converts the USB interface to the RS485 interface.

The chip is responsible for converting USB data into RS485 signals and managing data transfer rates and flow control.</p><p>Using a USB to RS485 converter makes it convenient to connect a computer with devices that use the RS485 interface, enabling data transmission and communication.
