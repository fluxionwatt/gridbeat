This significantly reduces the latency associated with sending data to a centralized cloud for processing. Real-time insights and actions can be derived more quickly, enabling faster response times for critical applications.</p><p>By processing data at the edge, GridBeat and eKuiper can filter and aggregate data before sending it to the cloud or central server. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over the network, optimizing bandwidth usage and reducing the costs associated with transmitting large volumes of data.</p><p>Leveraging GridBeat as an industrial gateway and eKuiper as a stream processing engine for edge processing brings benefits such as reduced latency, optimized bandwidth usage, improved reliability, enhanced security and privacy.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="Edge"></p><p>When GridBeat integrates with eKuiper, it can benefit from several advantages that enhance its capabilities in industrial IoT environments. Here are some benefits of GridBeat integrating with eKuiper:</p><p><b>Real-Time Data Analysis</b> eKuiper provides real-time analytics and stream processing capabilities. By integrating with eKuiper, GridBeat can leverage this functionality to perform real-time analysis of factory production data. This enables efficient control of product quality by detecting and addressing issues promptly, improving overall production processes and reducing wastage.</p><p><b>Device Twin Functionality</b> eKuiper offers features for data cleansing, transformation, and compression. GridBeat can benefit from this device twin functionality by ensuring that the data collected from devices is cleaned, standardized, and optimized for further processing. This ensures the reliability and consistency of data used for decision-making and analysis.</p><p><b>Abnormal Sensing and Alarm Handling</b> With eKuiper&#39;s abnormal sensing capabilities, GridBeat can detect anomalies or deviations in data patterns. It can then trigger alarms and notifications for proactive handling and response. This helps in identifying and addressing potential issues or failures in real-time, minimizing downtime and optimizing operational efficiency.</p><p><b>Production Process Optimization</b> By integrating with eKuiper, GridBeat can leverage the power of AI and machine learning algorithms for production process optimization. eKuiper&#39;s capabilities augment GridBeat&#39;s ability to analyze data, identify patterns, and make data-driven recommendations for optimizing production processes. This can lead to improved efficiency, reduced costs, and enhanced overall performance.</p><p><b>Flexible Data Interfacing</b> eKuiper provides flexible data interfacing capabilities, allowing GridBeat to pull and integrate data from various sources such as factory MES, ERP systems, databases, and third-party applications. This enables GridBeat to have a comprehensive view of the industrial site&#39;s data, facilitating holistic analysis, decision-making, and collaboration between different systems and stakeholders.</p><p><b>Integration with Time-Series Databases</b> eKuiper has the capability to push data to time-series databases. By integrating with eKuiper, GridBeat can efficiently store and retrieve time-series data, enabling historical analysis, trend detection, and long-term data insights. This helps in gaining a deeper understanding of the industrial processes and facilitates predictive maintenance and forecasting.</p><p><b>Edge-Side AI Model Integration</b> eKuiper allows for the integration of edge-side AI models, enabling real-time inference and decision-making. GridBeat can benefit from this integration by incorporating AI models within its operations. This empowers GridBeat to make intelligent decisions at the edge, reducing latency and dependency on cloud connectivity while enabling quicker responses and localized intelligence.</p><p>These benefits enhance GridBeat&#39;s capabilities in collecting, processing, and analyzing data in industrial IoT environments, enabling efficient and intelligent decision-making for improved operational performance.</p>',14)])])}const h=i(r,[["render",o]]);export{m as __pageData,h as default};
