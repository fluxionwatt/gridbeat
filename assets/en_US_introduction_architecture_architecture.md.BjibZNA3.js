These data tags consist of addresses and attributes that describe the data in devices or PLCs. The Manager ensures that these configurations are up-to-date and accessible for efficient data processing.</p><p><b>Plugin management:</b> Users have the flexibility to dynamically load or unload dynamic .so files (shared object files) at any time. The Manager module facilitates this capability and allows users to register these files as alternative plugins in the plugins table. This way, users can extend the functionality of the system by adding or removing plugins as needed.</p><p><b>Adapter management:</b> The Manager module enables users to select the required plugins based on their desired functionality and the services provided by the plugins, as outlined in the plugin table. By managing the adapters, the Manager ensures that the appropriate plugins are utilized for data communication and processing between the nodes.</p><p><b>Group management:</b> When a group of data tags is created, users have the option to subscribe to this group. This subscription triggers the creation of a subscription table for routing purposes. The Manager module utilizes this subscription table to route the data messages to the subscribed nodes, ensuring that the data is delivered to the relevant recipients within the group.</p><p><b>Message routing:</b> A critical task performed by the Manager module is the routing of incoming data messages to the appropriate end nodes based on the data tag configurations. It leverages the information within the data tags to determine the destination nodes for each message, ensuring that the data is directed to the intended recipients effectively.</p><h2 id="efficient-multi-thread-management" tabindex="-1">Efficient Multi-thread Management <a class="header-anchor" href="#efficient-multi-thread-management" aria-label="Permalink to “Efficient Multi-thread Management”">​</a></h2><p>GridBeat adopts an edge-native design optimized for modern CPUs&#39; multi-core architecture, including ARM and RISC-V embedded systems.

This approach enables messages to be processed concurrently by sending them to the desired nodes simultaneously, utilizing a parallel thread pool. To optimize this processing, southbound driver nodes (data producers) are advised to organize data streams into groups. In turn, northbound application nodes (data consumers) can subscribe to specific data stream groups from different nodes based on their requirements. This mechanism allows for efficient and flexible data flow within the system, enhancing overall performance and scalability.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="Aggregation"></p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="Replication"></p>',37)])])}const v=a(c,[["render",h]]);export{y as __pageData,v as default};
